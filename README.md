# Machine Learning Data Science Bootcamp

This respository is dedicated to what I learned from Daniel Bourke and Andrei Neagoie in this udemy course,
[Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/)

### 01. Heart Disease Classification
<hr>

This project focus on working specifically on structured data.
1.	Problem Definition: Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict if they have heart disease.
2.	Data: The data that we have is found in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
3.	Evaluation: If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting if a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we will pursue the project.
4.	Features: There are 14 features available in the dataset, which we will identify which feature are of higher importance.
5.	Modelling: Will be using the following tools, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, SKlearn and Jupyter to build a few machine learning models.
6.	Experiments: Will be experimenting with several machine learning models such as logistics regression, KNN, Random Forest and Catboost for this dataset.
