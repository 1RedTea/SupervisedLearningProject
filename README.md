# Machine Learning Data Science Bootcamp

This respository is dedicated to what I learned from Daniel Bourke and Andrei Neagoie in this udemy course,
[Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/)

### 01. Heart Disease Classification

In this notebook, I will be using logistics regression to predict whether someone has a heart disease or not. Using KNN, Logistic Regression and Random Forest I will use these machine learning models to determine which model returns the best evaluation, in terms of  accuracy, precision, recall and F1. I will also look into fine tuning the hyperparameters of the model with both RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to get the best out of the model
